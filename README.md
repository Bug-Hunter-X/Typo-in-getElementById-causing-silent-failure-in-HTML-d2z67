# Uncommon HTML Bug: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle but common error in HTML/JavaScript: a typo in the `getElementById` method.

The `bug.html` file contains the incorrect code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  The bug is a simple typo that can be easily missed, leading to unexpected behavior and difficulty debugging.

This is a great example for illustrating the importance of careful coding and thorough testing to avoid silent failures.
